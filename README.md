Git is a REPO (Repository for saving stuff). 

gitHUB is a cloud based provider for storying your crap in a place. 
Where you, your servers, and collaborators can edit, improve, iterate, and use it from anywhere. 

You need to "fork" this repo, by that i mean clone it and move it to your owned repo space. 
I don't mean a non-detention way of say the fbomb.
